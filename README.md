## Election-Audit Summary
The election committee could use this script for any election, with some simple adaptations. For instance, if the election committee wanted to breakdown the results by county, rather than state, to see how the candidates performed in each individual county. This could also be done on a national level, where the county is replaced by state and the overall winner could be winner of a Presiential election (assuming it was based off popular vote).
